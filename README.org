#+title: Simple Sets

* Introduction

This Common Lisp ~simple-sets~ package provides a very simple interface to sets
and relations.  A set is in essence a list and can be operated on in the same
way as lists with ~union~, ~adjoin~, etc.  However, when making sets, one
specifies the test function.  In essence, the only goal of this library is to
make sets available in such a way that you don't have to specify the test
function all the time.  The source code has been provided as Org-mode files
that also export to documentation.
