* Introduction

The ~simple-sets~ package provides a very simple interface to sets and
relations.  A set is in essence a list and can be operated on in the same way
as lists with ~union~, ~adjoin~, etc.  However, when making sets, one specifies
the test function.  In essence, the only goal of this library is to make sets
available in such a way that you don't have to specify the test function all
the time.  The code has been released under the GPLv3 license, see
Sec. [[copying]].
