Relations form a small extension to sets.  It is simply a tuple that is
represented by a ~cons~ that is added to a set.  Again, it is necessary to
provide a ~test~ function.

#+begin_src lisp
(defclass simple-relation (simple-set) ())

(defun make-relation (&key (test #'equal))
  (make-instance 'simple-relation :test test))
#+end_src

We defined the following generic functions on relations:

#+begin_src lisp
(defgeneric add-to-rel (a b relation)
  (:documentation "Make a tuple of a and b and add it to the relation."))
(defgeneric add-tuple-to-rel (tuple relation)
  (:documentation "Add tuple to the relation."))
(defgeneric subscribe-rel (key relation)
  (:documentation "Get the set of values that relate to key."))
#+end_src

The implementation:

#+begin_src lisp
(defmethod add-to-rel (a b (relation simple-relation))
  (add-tuple-to-rel (cons a b) relation))

(defmethod add-tuple-to-rel (tuple (relation simple-relation))
  (add-to-set tuple relation))

(defmethod subscribe-rel (key (relation simple-relation))
  (with-slots (elements test) relation
    (let ((set (make-set :test test)))
      (add-all-to-set
       (mapcar #'cdr 
	       (remove-if-not (complement #'(lambda (x) (funcall test (car x) key))) elements)) set)
      set)))
